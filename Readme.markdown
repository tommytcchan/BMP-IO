BMP I/O
=======


Introduction
------------

**BMP I/O** is a lightweight Java library for reading and writing Windows BMP files.

Supported reading formats:

* Paletted 1-bit
* Paletted 4-bit
* Paletted 4-bit with RLE compression
* Paletted 8-bit
* Paletted 8-bit with RLE compression
* RGB 8,8,8
* RGBA 8,8,8,8

Bitmap files with image data in bottom-to-top order (common) and top-to-bottom order (unusual) are supported.

Supported writing formats:

* RGB 8,8,8


Demo
----

In the `demo` directory, run the class `SimpleDemo` with the command `java SimpleDemo`. It will create a sample file `Demo.bmp` in the current directory.

Full listing of demos:

* SimpleDemo: Draws a square for each of the 8 extreme colors, and four 2D gradient squares. This shows that the image is in true color (rather than paletted 256-color, etc.).
* MandelbrotDemo: Draws a black-and-white image of the main part of the Mandelbrot set. The image is computed on the fly when each pixel is being requested for writing.
* ReadDemo: Reads Demo.bmp (which can be in any color format) and writes Demo2.bmp with the same image contents but in RGB 8,8,8 true color.
